# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Overview

Graph Algorithm Visualizer is a browser-based interactive tool that enables users to construct graphs and visualize classical traversal algorithms. Users can toggle between directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted modes and add/delete nodes and edges dynamically. The application supports step-by-step visualization for Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra’s algorithm, providing logs and annotated nodes to help understand traversal behavior. This tool is designed to enhance intuition around graph algorithms through visual interactivity.

## Project Category

Code Implementation

This project falls under the Code Implementation category. We implemented graph algorithms from scratch, integrated them with a force-directed graph visualizer using D3.js, and created an interactive frontend using React and TypeScript.

## Work Breakdown

Bailey  
- Implemented BFS and Dijkstra’s algorithm  
- Improved UI/UX for consistency across the app  
- Refactored DFS logic to align with what was taught in class

Estelle  
- Set up the initial UI/UX layout and component structure  
- Implemented the initial version of the DFS algorithm  
- Built the algorithm selection and setup panel

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Features

- Add and delete nodes and edges from the graph
- Toggle between directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted graphs
- Select and run DFS, BFS, or Dijkstra's algorithm
- Visualize traversal step-by-step with logs and annotations
- Edit node labels and edge weights interactively
